# EasyWinPortForward
A small windows application to port foward internally (especially useful for WSL)

By default, WSL only has its port accesible from the host machine under localhost
This tool allows you to forward multiple ports to the network (not only for WSL) and make them visible to LAN.

(An overengineering of the netsh command)
